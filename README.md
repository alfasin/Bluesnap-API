<b>Bluesnap API</b>
<br>
Bluesnap is an online payment processor as well as my employer :)<br>
This project started from a code-example I wrote for fun during the weekend in order to see how difficult is it to implement our own API.
Later on I used it to help Bluesnap merchants and finally I decided to take it one step forwrd and implement more calls to web-services.<br>
On that point <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-hultin/40/877/827">Ben Hultin</a> came into the picture 
and was kind enough to help me implement the rest of the services.

The PHP code examples implement the following web-services:<br>
1. create and update shopper entities<br>
2. place orders<br>
3. manage subscriptions<br>
4. use a token in order to "log a customer into" your Buy-Page<br>
5. Implementations of all kind of Bluesnap-API tools<br>
6. and more...

It is recommended to start with reading the Web-Services section in Bluesnap documentation center: http://www.bluesnap.com/helpcenter/Static/default.htm
